      p From the minute we met, something just clicked. We are so thankful that we found one another and have each other in our lives. Together anything seems possible, fun will be had, and great memories will be made. We both love our friends and family a ton and are looking forward to taking a big step towards our future, when we get married on October 18!

      p Let me tell you about Katrina Rachel Hassler. My best friend, and love of my life is one of the most important people I've ever met. She honestly makes me happier than I could explain to you in words. She keeps me grounded and modest, but at the same time she makes me feel like I could accomplish anything, with her rooting for me in my corner. She is my partner in crime. When I was younger I used to wonder if I would ever meet someone who would make me feel like spending the rest of my life with them. Now I know exactly who she is. Katrina loves her family and friends so much. She would honestly do anything for them. Katrina is hard-working and intelligent, but can also be the biggest goofball you've ever met. I consider myself such a lucky guy to be marrying such an amazing girl. I can't wait to see what life has in store for us.

      p Jeremiah is the most patient, kind hearted, hard-working person I know. I feel blessed for each and every day I get to spend with him by my side. Each day with JD is full of optimism and laughter. He is always down to try one of my crazy ideas at least once. I can't wait for a future with my best friend by my side.
