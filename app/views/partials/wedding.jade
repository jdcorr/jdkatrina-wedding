    h2 The Wedding
    p We are very much looking forward to sharing the big day with friends and family. If it proves to be anything like our time together, it will be full of great times, laughs, and our loved ones. 
    p Beach Volleyball: Asilomar has a volleyball court just waiting for you on the beach. Bring your own volleyball or stop in the Park Store to borrow one of ours. The court can be reserved through our Front Desk. Court usage is complimentary but a $5 refundable deposit is required for the use of our volleyball.
    p Biking: Trail riding or beach riding - why not do both?  If you don't have your own bike, we have bikes available for rent at the Park Store.
    p Golf: There are numerous golf courses - Pacific Grove is directly north of Pebble Beach.

      +hRule('toast')
      p Immediately following the ceremony, a reception will take place just a short walk across the street and down the boardwalk that meanders through the 25 acres of restored sand dune ecosystem leading to Asilomar Conference Center. Please follow the path to Merrill Hall. There is limited street parking at the beach so it is suggested to arrive early and park at the B Lot near Merrill Hall. The walk to the beach is less than 10 min. The trail is very accessible and a beach wheelchair is available upon request.
